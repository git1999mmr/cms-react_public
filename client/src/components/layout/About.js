        <h3 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem' }}>
          <ol>
            <li style={{ marginTop: '1%' }}>
              <b>Accounting: </b> As project cost and expenditures must be
              closely monitored, a project construction software must be able to
              integrate with other business accounting tools. This feature helps
              managers handle multiple projects at any given time. It must

              capable of setting standard rates for company services, defining
              costs, and monitoring time expenses. This functionality should

              using a single platform. Doing so greatly helps boost
              productivity, workflow processes, and information security. The
              system should also be able to integrate with other business
              productivity tools.
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginTop: '1%' }}>
              <b>Inventory Management: </b> Inventory management capability
              essentially eliminates write-offs, does quick inventories, quickly
              finds lost inventory, and monitors on-site assets. It likewise
              assists project managers in resource and equipment distribution.
